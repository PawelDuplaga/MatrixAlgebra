Matrix Algebra Library in C#
This library is designed for matrix algebra, especially for neural networks. The implementation is done using C# programming language.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To use this library, you need the following software installed on your computer:

.NET 5
Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code
Build the project using your favorite IDE or by running dotnet build command in the project directory
Reference the resulting DLL file in your own project
Usage
Creating a Matrix
To create a new matrix, use the following code:

csharp
Copy code
Matrix<int> m = new Matrix<int>(3, 3);
This creates a new 3x3 matrix with integer values.

You can also create a new matrix from an existing 2D array:

```csharp
int[,] data = { { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 }, { 7, 8, 9 } };
Matrix<int> m = new Matrix<int>(data);\
```
Accessing Matrix Elements
You can access matrix elements using the indexing operator:

csharp
Copy code
int element = m[0, 0];
Matrix Arithmetic
The library supports basic arithmetic operations on matrices, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Here are some examples:

csharp
Copy code
Matrix<int> a = new Matrix<int>(2, 2);
Matrix<int> b = new Matrix<int>(2, 2);

// matrix addition
Matrix<int> c = a + b;

// matrix subtraction
Matrix<int> d = a - b;

// matrix multiplication
Matrix<int> e = a * b;
Transpose
You can also calculate the transpose of a matrix:

csharp
Copy code
Matrix<int> a = new Matrix<int>(2, 3);

Matrix<int> b = a.Transpose();
Determinant
Finally, you can calculate the determinant of a 2x2 matrix:

csharp
Copy code
Matrix<int> a = new Matrix<int>(2, 2);

int determinant = a.Determinant2x2();
